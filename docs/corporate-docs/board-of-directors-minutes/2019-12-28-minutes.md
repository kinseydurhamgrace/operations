    Please see below for signer change procedure.


     


    Signer Change



1. We will need the attached Change of Signer form completed and  signed by two current signers (if applicable) stating the following:
    1. List all accounts effected by the change
    2. New signer’s (full name and social security number)
2. Complete the attached Business Account Worksheet in its entirety (we will be using this for the new account as well)
3. Complete the attached Beneficial Ownership Form (BridgeFoundry is a registered 501C3; therefore, there are no beneficial owners.) We still need somebody from your organization to attest to this statement. I am happy to jump on a call and discuss further.
4. Provide a copy of a current ID for each signer (new and existing)

Given that the above signer policy will enable review by second authorized signer ensuring that the [General Signatory and Banking Authority Policy](https://operations.bridgefoundry.org/corporate-docs/policy/signatory-and-banking/) would be followed, and upon motion duly made and seconded, the Board unanimously approved the following resolution:
